# Urban Tree Species Classification using Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope

## Overview

This repository contains the code and datasets used for the research paper **"Urban trees species classification using Sentinel-2 and Planetscope satellite image time series"**, presented at JURSE 2025 in Tunis, Tunisia (May 4-7, 2025). The study focuses on classifying the 20 most representative urban tree species in Strasbourg using deep learning models applied to Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) from Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope.

### Key Features
- Utilizes **InceptionTime, H-InceptionTime, and LITE** models for multivariate Time Series Classification (TSC).
- Implements **sensor fusion** to combine spectral and temporal features from Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope.
- Achieves **69% accuracy** using the best-performing model (H-InceptionTime with sensor fusion).
- Codebase written in **PyTorch**.

## Dataset
- **Sentinel-2**: 10 spectral bands, 10-20m resolution, 22 cloud-free images (2022).
- **PlanetScope**: 4-band imagery, 3.125m resolution, 53 cloud-free images (2022).
- Data preprocessing includes **zonal statistics**, buffer-based feature extraction, and co-registration.

## Results
| Model        | Sentinel-2 | PlanetScope | Fusion (S2 + PS) |
|-------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| InceptionTime  | 62.9% Â± 0.4% | 62.2% Â± 1.3% | 67.7% Â± 1.4% |
| H-InceptionTime | 63.0% Â± 0.3% | 62.4% Â± 1.0% | 69.1% Â± 0.3% |
| LITE         | 45.7% Â± 2.4% | 48.7% Â± 2.5% | 56.1% Â± 2.5% |
